## Project Description
This project applies a BERT model to a sequence classification task in NLP. It includes the full pipeline from data preprocessing, model training, to performance evaluation.

## Installation
To set up this project:
1. Clone the repo with the latest version: https://github.com/kozgunov/NLP_encoder/blob/main/5th%20version
2. Install required packages locally
3. write your text and get the sentimental replies

## Usage
Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:



## Features
- BERT-based sequence classification
- Customizable model parameters
- Comprehensive performance metrics evaluation
